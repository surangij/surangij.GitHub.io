The IGSR allows accessibility of data from the 1000 Genomes project, which spans data from 2008 to 2015,
containing the largest human genotype data. Genotype data consists of high coverage sequence data from the New York Genome Center for 1000 Genome samples.
This could be used for applications for the healthcare and drawing correlations between gene mutations and cancer types or treatments.
